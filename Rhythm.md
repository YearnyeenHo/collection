|[Tempo-beat-and-downbeat-estimation-for-electronic-dance-music](https://github.com/SomeshGanesh94/Tempo-beat-and-downbeat-estimation-for-electronic-dance-music) | This project aims to estimate the tempo (in BPM or beats per minute), the locations of the beats and downbeats of a song in the genre of electronic dance music using some feature extraction and autocorrelation and cross-correlation techniques.
|[Beat and Downbeat Tracking of Symbolic Music Data](https://github.com/chuang76/symbolic-beat-tracking)|a symbolic beat tracking system that performs joint beat and downbeat tracking in a multi-task learning (MTL) manner. The proposed models are based on variants of recurrent neural networks (RNN), All the models are implemented with the PyTorch framework.|
